Usage:

  In ThemeEditor, right click "Scripts", select "New Script"

  Name: Exactly the same as the script you intend to use, without .cs on the end.
  Language: Always C#
  Template: Generic converter script is fine.

  Copy and paste the content from the script on GitHub and fully replace the script in the theme editor window, press CTRL+S to save, and look for a green check. 

  In the script's comment block (typically the first few lines) there will be a listed 'databinding' that is required to be passed in. If there is no specified binding,
  pick any binding that updates as frequently as you need and the script will run to match. (For weather events, pass in the temperature. As the temperature changes you will 
  see the converter script run again.) I do not know that this is the best way. If I learn of a better method I will post it here.

Rights:

  All code is available to use during iRacing broadcasts utilizing the ATVO application by Appgineering https://atvo.appgineering.com/.
  Broadcasts must adhere to the guidelines listed by iRacing.com https://www.iracing.com/membership/iracing-broadcast-policy/. 
  View the License for details. TL;DR: Ok to use (even commercially), Ok to modify with restrictions. 

  I request that you disclose the source of these scripts (aka a link to this GitHub) if you use these scripts for profit. iRacing broadcasting should be as 
  accessable as possible, and I know these scripts aren't world shattering, but I hope they can help more people take the dive into making unique and innovative themes.

Requesting New Code:

  I am more than happy to point you in the right direction if you are attempting to modify or create new scripts for ATVO. Please join my Discord server and hopefully
  we can further build out a community to support independent broadcasting! Join: https://discord.gg/aRcbgCJ48g
